List Pagination and Filtering
Given a list of students this program will first paginate the list. Limiting the page to only show 10 at a time. Using unobtrusive JavaScript there is a search box added that will filter the list to only the ones searched for and paginate those results. Also added a keyup eventlistener to search list in real-time.
